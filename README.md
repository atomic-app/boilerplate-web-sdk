# Atomic Web SDK Multiple Containers Demo

This app demonstrates various available container formats, such as the Single Card view, Vertical Stream, and Launcher. They are configured in the `src/App.tsx` file where additional UI customisations can also be adjusted. More detailed documentation on what customisation is available can be found in the [Web SDK Configuration Options](https://documentation.atomic.io/sdks/web#configuration-options).
